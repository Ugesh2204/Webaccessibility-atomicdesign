      Nielsen Norman Group gives some criteria on when to use accordions and when to avoid using it. In short, when all the page content is relevant to users, it is more advantageous to show all the content at once, even if doing so results in longer pages. On the desktop it is easier to simply scroll the page than to decide on which topics to click on.`
